# v0.2.0

v0.2.0 makes MirrorSim easier to control and moves the Windows distribution to
a fully OSI-approved receiver stack. It adds customizable keyboard shortcuts,
refreshes the Rust dependencies, and preserves the stable mirroring, audio,
capture, recording, orientation, trust, and update experience from v0.1.5.

## Customizable controls

- Adds a keyboard-shortcut editor under **Preferences > Support**.
- Supports custom bindings for audio mute, screenshots, recording, view mode,
  fullscreen, Minimal controls, Preferences, and diagnostics.
- Detects conflicting assignments before saving and provides a one-click reset
  to the default bindings.
- Updates in-app shortcut hints to reflect the active bindings.

## Open receiver media stack

- Replaces Fraunhofer FDK AAC with FFmpeg 8.1.2's LGPL AAC-ELD decoder.
- Preserves iPhone audio, stereo playback, mute, recording audio, and
  phone-volume following with the new decoder.
- Removes the obsolete MSYS2 runtime dependency from the shipped receiver.
- Pins the immutable AirPlayServer v0.5.0 runtime and its published SHA-256
  checksum.
- Ships a smaller FFmpeg build containing only the AAC and H.264 decoders and
  the required `libavcodec`, `libavutil`, and `libswscale` libraries.

## Distribution and project readiness

- Adds WinGet package metadata and the public policies required for community
  support, privacy, security reporting, and release provenance.
- Documents the Authenticode signing process while the SignPath Foundation
  application is under review.
- Refreshes the desktop and receiver Rust dependency sets after full build,
  lint, test, and audit validation.

## Licensing and provenance

- The receiver distribution contains components under OSI-approved MIT, BSD,
  zlib, LGPL, and GPL licenses.
- AirPlayServer's release workflow rejects any return of the removed FDK source
  tree and verifies that FFmpeg was built with GPL, nonfree, and version-3
  components disabled.
- AirPlayServer v0.5.0 publishes the exact FFmpeg 8.1.2 source archive, source
  checksum, build configuration, runtime checksum, and GitHub build-provenance
  attestations.
- MirrorSim's packaged notices describe the receiver files actually included in
  the release.

## Compatibility

The receiver keeps adapter protocol `0.8.0` and its existing `pcm-audio`,
`sender-volume`, `video-geometry`, `video-sender-state`, and `external-dnssd`
capabilities. Existing trusted-device records and application settings are
preserved when updating from v0.1.5. MirrorSim remains a Windows x64
application.

## Install

Choose one of the attached Windows builds:

- `MirrorSim_*_x64-setup.exe` - recommended NSIS installer.
- `MirrorSim_*_x64_en-US.msi` - MSI package for managed or advanced
  installations.
- `MirrorSim-portable-*.zip` - portable build with no installation required.

Windows may show a SmartScreen warning because the binaries are updater-signed
but are not yet Windows Authenticode-signed. SHA-256 hashes are included in
`checksums.txt`, and the GitHub release includes updater artifacts and
build-provenance attestations. See MirrorSim's
[code signing policy](https://github.com/Mahcks/MirrorSim/blob/main/CODE_SIGNING.md)
for the current status and verification details.
